# Air Canvas
Welcome to the Air Canvas project! ðŸš€

# Description
Air Canvas is an exciting project where we've created an interactive digital canvas using Python. With this fun tool, users can draw and manipulate digital art in real-time, all with just their hand gestures! We've used cool computer vision techniques to make the drawing experience engaging and intuitive.

# Technology Used
OpenCV: We've harnessed the power of OpenCV to bring this interactive air canvas to life. OpenCV allows us to track hand gestures and translate them into dynamic digital art on the canvas.

Enjoy creating digital art with Air Canvas! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨
